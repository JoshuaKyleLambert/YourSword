The gates to the city. Nothing unusual here except that they're
new. Everyone pictures gates in medevil times as being old 
rusted looking things. They had to be new once and these are.
Big ass dragon statue.

Forest,Gates,Toren's_House,Tavern
The Forest is a thing of legend. Spanning for unknown distances 
to the east, it's massive trees providing a thick canopy causing the
forest floor below to exist in a perpetual twilight. There is always
a faint glow emanating from the various bioluminecent plant life.
with a little time it's possible see through the darkness.
There exits patches where there is no light at all.

Torens House is the place to be apparently.

Toren's_Room,Toren's_House
Smells like passion..
###
Toren's_Kitchen,Toren's_House
Insects scurry away from the movement as you enter the grime covered
room once used to prepare meals. Now this is abandoned portion of
the house is used to store piles of dishes and togo boxes that wait
for someone to care for them. No one cares in Toren's house.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
